# 2018-week-5-lesson-plan

This group enjoys mathematical thinking, so we mostly ended up messing around with while loops. Each person did different things with while loops in the end, and I think the amount of time that they were working on making the code rather than copying made the lesson a lot of fun. I would say 8/10, but a lot of that is due to this specific group's preferences.
